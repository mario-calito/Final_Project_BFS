This is a project using the programming language Rust which applies Breath First Search Algorithm to a data set which I used from Kaggle. The objective of this project is to find out how many people (user-id) listen to similar artist using BFS algorithm. 
The data set includes spotify playlist data (user-id, playlist name, artist, and song name). Using Pythons Pandas library in Jupyter Notebook, I was able to import a csv file and clean the data from any hidden variables, missing data or anything invaluable which then exported as a cleaned file. I also reduced the amount columns I used. Only using user-id and artist in the Rust code to find how many artist are listened to by unique users. The code is 95% done as there is a couple of bugs with data types that still need to be fixed. Overall, happy with the objective and how much work has been done so far.
